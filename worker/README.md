# Worker module

`worker/` contains server-facing entry adapters and bounded integration/operations endpoints for the portal.

## Responsibilities

- expose HTTP/domain entrypoints used by the built Worker/server contract;
- apply existing auth, authorization, same-origin, service-admin and maintenance boundaries before privileged domain actions;
- adapt health, diagnostics, recovery, storage and integration contracts to HTTP/runtime entrypoints.

## Non-responsibilities

- do not define a second permission registry, route registry, schema registry or configuration registry;
- do not expose FreeIPA credentials, Gateway credentials, service tokens or recovery secrets to browser code;
- do not bypass canonical domain/security owners merely because an entrypoint is easier to change here.

## Canonical references

- `docs/reference/API.md`
- `docs/reference/PERMISSIONS.md`
- `docs/reference/ERROR_CODES.md`
- `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`
- `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- profile runbooks for backup/restore, maintenance, storage and health.

## Verification

Run the narrow worker/domain contract tests for the changed boundary. Auth, permission, mutation or browser-observable routing changes normally require the relevant Auth E2E scope. Recovery/storage/health changes require their profile contract tests and runbook review.

Update normalized references only when the external contract changes; keep implementation details in their canonical source modules.
